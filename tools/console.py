"""console — the CI gates print UTF-8 regardless of the console's code page.

A gate prints a finding's path and message, and either can be non-ASCII: a
Hangul path, an em dash in a message. A Windows console reports cp949 or
cp1252; printing there died with ``UnicodeEncodeError`` mid-print, exit 1 as
if the gate had judged, with the finding itself lost. The plugin's own
entry points do the same through ``gatekit.hookio.utf8_stdio``; tools/ is
stdlib-only and imports nothing from plugin/, so it keeps its own copy.

Each gate runs as ``python tools/gate_*.py``, which puts tools/ first on
``sys.path``, so ``import console`` resolves here.
